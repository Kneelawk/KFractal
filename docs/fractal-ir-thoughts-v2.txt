Programs have:
 * Global Variable Declarations
 * Structures? // No, structure types are described by their contents, not by their names. No structure types must have
    type names. Otherwise, it would be impossible to have a structure that contains pointers to itself or structures
    containing itself.
 * Functions

All Functions have a type.
All Functions are base-level.

Variable values of function type simply reference a function,
just like how variables of bool type "reference" true or false
or how variables of complex type "reference" complex numbers.

Variable values of function type also contain context variables.
These context variables can be pointers, or normal variables.

Variables would have types:
 * Void (not valid for variable types, but valid for function return types)
 * Bool
 * Int
 * Real (double)
 * Complex (is likely a structure in implementations)
 * Function (contains a function pointer or name, and context variables) (is derived type)
    (type signature depends on target function's signature) (context variable types can be verified at compile type
    when creating the function variable)
 * Pointer (backing memory must be explicitly allocated. can have backing memory of any of these variable types)
    (backing memory may be subject to reference-counting, or garbage collection) (is derived type)
!* Structure (is derived type) (maybe shouldn't have this) (can-of-worms) (makes reference-counting GC impossible)

Functions would have:
 * Name
 * Return Type
 * Context Variable Declarations (in practice, context variables would likely be part of the arguments list, but would
    come from the function variable's stored set of context variables)
 * Argument Variable Declarations
 * Local Variable Declarations
 * Instructions

Structures would be:
Structure type should be a reference to a structure definition.
Structures should not be in a programming language designed for generating fractals.

Some Instructions could be:
 * ComplexAdd(Complex, Complex, Complex) (adds the last two complex numbers and stores the sum in the first)
 * ComplexMultiply(Complex, Complex, Complex) (multiplies the last two complex numbers and stores the product in the first)
 * PointerAllocate(Pointer(*)) (allocates memory and stores the reference to that memory in the argument)
 * FunctionCall(Function(*), *, [ ** ]) (calls a function with its context if it has any) (all variables are copied,
    Pointers maintain their reference though, so setting the referenced value of a pointer here will set in other places
    too.)
 * Return(*) (exits the current function and returns control flow over to the parent function, variables declared in the
    current function are de-allocated, including Pointers. If pointers are using a reference-counting system, this is
    where the referenced value would decrease its number of references.)

Some InstructionIOs could be:
 * VariableReference
 * BoolConstant
 * IntConstant
 * RealConstant
 * ComplexConstant
 * FunctionContextConstant
 * NullPointer

InstructionIO type compatibility with Instructions should be validated when the IR is compiled into something else,
meaning that the IR structure is built in a way that can have mistyped arguments, but hopefully provides enough
information for a compiler of that IR to be able to detect those mistypes.

Simple Program:
Program(
[ ], // global variables
[ // functions
    "main"=FunctionDefinition(
        "main", // name
        COMPLEX, // return type
        [ ], // context variables
        [ // arguments
            "z"=VariableDeclaration("z", COMPLEX),
            "c"=VariableDeclaration("c", COMPLEX)
        ],
        [ // local variables
            "tmp0"=VariableDeclaration("tmp0", COMPLEX)
        ],
        [ // instructions
            ComplexMultiply(VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("z"), VariableReference("z")),
            ComplexAdd(VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("c")),
            Return("tmp0")
        ]
    )
]
)
Easy, simple. Memory management is not nearly so much of an issue now because each declaration comes with its own
allocated piece of memory. Only Pointers have to have explicitly allocated memory, and that's just because the data they
hold is the reference to memory.

Slightly more complicated program:
Program(
[ ],
[
    "main"=FunctionDefinition(
        "main",
        COMPLEX,
        [ ],
        [
            "z"=VariableDeclaration("z", COMPLEX),
            "c"=VariableDeclaration("c", COMPLEX)
        ],
        [
            "z2"=VariableDeclaration("z2", COMPLEX),
            "tmp0"=VariableDeclaration("tmp0", COMPLEX)
        ],
        [
            ComplexMultiply(VariableReference("z2"), VariableReference("z"), VariableReference("z")),
            FunctionCall(FunctionContext("cos", [ ]), VariableReference("tmp0"), [ VariableReference("z2") ]),
            ComplexAdd(VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("z2"), VariableReference("tmp0")),
            ComplexAdd(VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("tmp0"), VariableReference("c")),
            Return("tmp0")
        ]
    )
]
)

Program in C:
struct complex_t complex_add(struct complex_t a, struct complex_t b);
struct complex_t complex_multiply(struct complex_t a, struct complex_t b);
struct complex_t cos(struct complex_t x);
struct complex_t f(struct complex_t z, struct complex_t c) {
    struct complex_t z2;
    z2 = complex_multiply(z, z);
    return complex_add(complex_add(z2, cos(z2)), c);
}

Program in LLVM Bytecode:
declare { double, double } @complex_multiply(double, double, double, double)
declare { double, double } @complex_add(double, double, double, double)
declare { double, double } @cos(double, double)
define { double, double } @f(double %z.coerce0, double %z.coerce1, double %c.coerce0, double %c.coerce1) {
entry:
  %call = tail call { double, double } @complex_multiply(double %z.coerce0, double %z.coerce1, double %z.coerce0, double %z.coerce1)
  %0 = extractvalue { double, double } %call, 0
  %1 = extractvalue { double, double } %call, 1
  %call2 = tail call { double, double } @cos(double %0, double %1)
  %2 = extractvalue { double, double } %call2, 0
  %3 = extractvalue { double, double } %call2, 1
  %call3 = tail call { double, double } @complex_add(double %0, double %1, double %2, double %3)
  %4 = extractvalue { double, double } %call3, 0
  %5 = extractvalue { double, double } %call3, 1
  %call4 = tail call { double, double } @complex_add(double %4, double %5, double %c.coerce0, double %c.coerce1)
  ret { double, double } %call4
}

            While(
                VariableReference("tmp2"),
                [
                    Assign(VariableReference("elem"), VariableReference("tmp1")),

            ),
            GetStructureComponent(VariableReference("tmp3"), VariableReference("tmp0"), "data"),
            Return(VariableReference("tmp3"))
        ]
    )
]
)

I created structures knowing that I could use a mark-and-sweep GC because structures open up the possibility for cyclic
references. I just remembered that my GPU targets probably won't have a GC however. I have two options: write my own
GC for GPUs, or use strong and weak pointers and force the compiler to keep track of it.

I don't actually know why I've been adding structures though. This is unneeded complexity.
I think it would be best for me to remove structures entirely.
