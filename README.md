# KFractal
A set of java libraries and tools for generating fractals.

## Post-Mortem
This project was fun but ultimately too large and unwieldy and I was never able to finish it. I had decided to build a complete function-based language including pointer-types, but the IR became too complex and I eventually abandoned it.

## Mandelbrot and Julia sets
This set of programs is designed to generate Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Mandelbrot and Julia sets are not true fractals in that they are only self-similar as one considers smaller and smaller regions.
