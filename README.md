# KFractal
A set of java libraries and tools for generating fractals.

## Mandelbrot and Julia sets
This set of programs is designed to generate Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Mandelbrot and Julia sets are not true fractals in that they are only self-similar as one considers smaller and smaller regions.
